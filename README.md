# Equation File Browser Interface Using Data Structure (Stack)

This project reads sample file, extracting:
1) infix equation
2) postfix equation

The contents of this file are then written to an XML file.

On the equation side, if the input contains infix expressions then convert it to postfix then calculate the result,
else if the input contains postfix expressions then convert it to prefix then calculate the result.

The program also checks whether the equation is balanced or invalid.

## Note that there is app_photo folder.
